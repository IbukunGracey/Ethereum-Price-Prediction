# Ethereum-Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a mobile app that helps to make predictions of the rise and fall of a cryptocurrency called Ethereum.

This is approached using machine learning algorithms to create models for prediction. A MVP has been developed using logistic regresssion and K-Nearest Neighbour. More algorithms will be used on the dataset to derive better accuracy.
